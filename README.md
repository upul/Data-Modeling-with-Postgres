# Data Modeling with Postgres

In this repository, we create an ETL pipeline to parse user activity data stored in JSON files. Extracted data are stored in a star schema created in a Postgres database. 

## How to Deploy and Run


## ETL Pipeline
We employed a two-stage approach to building our extract, transform, load (**ETL**) pipeline:
1. xxx
2. xxxx 

## Database Structure
Figure 1 shows the start scheme use used for the project. In our database scheme, we have one **fact table** (`songplays`) and four **dimensional tables** (`users`, `songs`, `artists`, `time`).
